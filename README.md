# Password Cracker

## Overview

This tool is designed to help users assess the strength of their passwords and protect themselves against brute force attacks. It generates password guesses using OpenAI's text generation capabilities, allowing users to test the resilience of their passwords against sophisticated cracking techniques.

## How It Works

The password cracker utilizes the OpenAI API to generate intelligent guesses based on the context of the password. Users provide a password to crack, and the tool generates several likely guesses using advanced natural language processing models. By analyzing the generated guesses, users can gain insights into the strength of their passwords and take appropriate measures to improve their security.

## Features
